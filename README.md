This is a project with the Tessel microcontroller and its GPRS and Relay modules. 

It lets you send a text to toggle a device on and off. You could also just use the GPRS code and trigger other Tessel modules to your heart's content.

To use this repo with your Tessel, first clone the repository locally and then run `npm install`.
